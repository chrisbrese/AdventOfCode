These are my solutions to Advent of Code [https://adventofcode.com/2020/about].

If you want to know if I have completed a specific puzzle, check the "sitePages" folder.
I update it with a print out of the page that includes both the directions for the day, and my correct answers.
If you don't see a site page for a specific puzzle, then I have not yet completed it.

I am not worried at this time about solving each puzzle inside the performance constraints provided by AoC.
